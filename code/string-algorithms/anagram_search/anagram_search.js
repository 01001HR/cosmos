// Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other, ignoring any whitespace.
//
// Remove whitespaces in both strings.
// Make all characters in both strings lowercase.
// Use .reduce() to create a hash table for each word containing the counts for each letter.
// Compare both hash tables to see if one contains any letters not contained in the other table.
//
// Check to ensure every unique character is used in both strings the same number of times.
