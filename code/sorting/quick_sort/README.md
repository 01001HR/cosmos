# Quicksort

Quicksort is generally one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. 

The steps are:

1. Choose an element in the array to be the pivot.
2. Divide all remaining elements into two categories: less than the pivot and greater than the pivot. The lesser elements go before the pivot, the greater elements go after.
3. Recursively apply the algorithm to these partitions, then combine all of the sorted partitions.
