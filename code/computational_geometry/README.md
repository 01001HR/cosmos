Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be formulated in geometric terms.  While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity. 

The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, polygons, polyhedra, etc.

###### Working of Sutherland Hodgeman Polygon Clipping

Coordinates of rectangular clip window :
xmin,ymin             :200 200
xmax,ymax             :400 400


Polygon to be clipped :
Number of sides       :3
Enter the coordinates :150 300
300 150    
300 300
